- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @chemtopotools, an organization jointly managed by @anmolecule and @rafaeljoselopez for hosting software packages and tools related to chemistry.

- ðŸ‘€ Currently you should find DAMQT package (similar packages: AIMALL, AIM2000, multiwfn) for analysis of electron density and electrostatic potential. In future, you should expect more softwares focused on assisting Quantum Mechanical and Molecular Mechanical analysis.
